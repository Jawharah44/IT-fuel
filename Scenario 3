Non-profit Company:

Dewgood is a small, local non-profit company of 50 employees. They hired you as the sole IT person in the company. The HR person tells you when they need a new computer for an employee. Currently, computers are purchased directly in a physical store on the day that an employee is hired. This is due to budget reasons, as they can’t keep extra stock in the store.

The company has a single server with multiple services on it, a file server, and email. They don’t currently have a messaging system in place. When a new employee is hired, you have to do an orientation with them for login. You’re also responsible for installing all the software they need on their machine, and mapping the file server to their computer. The computers are managed through Windows Active Directory. When an employee leaves, they’re currently not disabled in the directory service.

The company uses an open-source ticketing system to handle all internal requests as well as external non-profit requests. But the ticketing system is confusing and difficult to use, so lots of the employees reach out to you directly to figure out how to do things. In fact, so many things are difficult to find that employees typically ask around when they have a question.

There are nightly backups in place of the file server. You store this information on a disk backup and take it home with you everyday to keep it safe in case something happens onsite. There’s also a small company website that’s hosted on the single server at the company. This website is a single html page that explains the mission of the company and provides contact information. The website has gone down many times, and no one knows what to do when it happens.

Dewgood, being a small non-profit organization, has some notable areas for improvement in its current IT setup. 
1. Prepare Computers in Advance:
   - Instead of buying computers when someone starts, it's better to plan and buy them early. This ensures new team members can start working without delays.

2. Manage User Access:
   - We need a system that controls who can access what. When someone leaves, we must ensure their access is turned off. It safeguards our data and prevents ex-employees from accessing company resources.

3. Simplify Ticketing System:
   - The current system is confusing. We should either improve it or find an easier one that everyone can use. This reduces the need for constant help requests and improves overall employee productivity.

4. Securely Backup Files:
   - Taking backups home daily is risky. Exploring safer options like storing backups in the cloud ensures data safety. If something goes wrong onsite, our information remains protected.

5. Maintain Website Reliability:
   -  Our company website frequently goes down, causing confusion. Figuring out the reasons and considering a more stable hosting solution ensures our website stays online, providing information about our mission and how to contact us.
